# Python CSV to Firestore Collection
---
An application I am building to better understand the fundamentals of Google's Firestore, and how Python interacts with that

Mostly just practice for transforming data and working with a NoSQL document model

This is now virtually a script that could be tweaked to fit any model for reading in data to Firestore collections from a csv file

---

1. To run this script, first set up a Python virtual environment called env from the root directory of the project

  - `python3 -m venv env`


2. Next, install the dependencies by running from the root folder of the directory

  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

---

3. To run, either configure your IDE to run the venv OR

  - `source path/to/env/bin/activate`

4. This will activate your virtual environment, then just run a python script like this

  - `python ./my-script.py`
